Known Failures/Problems

Policy extensions are not implemented, so we skip tests #34-#53.

Tests #75 and #76 are skipped as they make use of relatively obscure CRL
extensions which are not supported.

In addition, please note that some of the tests have their results altered from
what the test result should be according to NIST's documentation. The changes
are clearly marked (see x509test.cpp; search for "CHANGE OF TEST RESULT") and
there are comments explaining why the results where changed. Currently, tests
#19, #65, and #67 have had their results changed from the official results.
