Project: Homomorphic Signatures on Polynomial Functions
=================================================================

  Install:
    Two libraries were used in this implementation, which are 
    displayed below.  In order to install, move the included 
    directories into the desired place, and then edit the 
    commented portions in the make file to insert the directory 
    of these libraries:
      1. NTL Library (Number Theory Library)
      2. Botan (for hash function)

  Formats:
    Two types of files require specific formats when read into
    the program:
  
    1. The encoded function has the following form:
       c_0 + c_1x^n + c_2x^n-1y + c_3x*n-1z ... c_
       
       and our "encoded function" is simply a list of
       these c_i in order, spaced apart.  Note that c_i
       must be within proper bounds of [-y/2, y/2]. 
    
    2. The set of data points that you feed into the
       system must first have a tag (interpreted as 
       a string) and then integer values following
       that.  Example:
      
       grades
       123
       23123
       234
